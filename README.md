#Responsify

Responsify is my take at creating a responsive grid system. It is largely based off of Bootstrap's grid system except Responsify uses percentages rather than multiples of 12. I found the multiples of 12 used in Bootstrap to be inefficient as it calls for a person to constantly convert the multiples into percents in their head.

**Example usage**
```
	<div class="container">
		<div class="col-33 col-md-50 col-xs-100"></div>
		<div class="col-33 col-md-50 col-xs-100"></div>
		<div class="col-33 col-md-100"></div>
	</div>
```
